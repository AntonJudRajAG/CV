        <h1>Anton Jud Raj</h1>
        <p><em>A student in <strong><a href="https://www.licet.ac.in/">Licet chennai</a>,</strong> pursuing <strong>ECE </strong>,</em>currently in my First year.</p>
        <p>Hello viewers..! This is Anton Jud Raj A G, umm.. you can call me Jude. This web page is made for the recruitment process
          of Team Pattarai, under the guidance of my mentor Ms. Sneha Bernard. As per the instructions I am supposed to make this
          web page about myself, as this is to be documented.All the information contained by this web page is neither completely
          real nor completely cooked up. Starting about myself, I live in Salem. I live in a six membered family, my grandparents, my parernts,me and my brother.
          I did most of my schooling is Salem. For my eleventh grade I moved to Ooty. Both of my schools were literally paradises to me.
          They taught me discipline and groomed my childhood in a really good way. I am an ambivert, so there are no particular situations
          where I isolate myself or or just keep chilling. From my childhood, I've had interest in technology and those stuffs, but got
          very less oppurtunities to explore them. So most of them were left unexplored. The main reason I wish to join Pattarai is
          to satisfy my appetite towards new innovations. Not a ranker in academics, but but really love to read. Novels are always
          my favourite stress busters and inspirers. Dan brown and Harry Potter novels are my all time ruling ones. I am a person who will never survive a day without a coffee. I am so much addicted to coffee,
          that once in my childhood I travelled 20 kilometers away from my home just to have a cup of coffee. Other than coffee and novels,
          I love to listen to music and I do hear a lot of them. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiphop_Tamizha"> Hip Hop Tamizha</a> sir, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuvan_Shankar_Raja">Yuvan</a> sir, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anirudh_Ravichander">Anirudh</a> sir, and the playlist goes on. Coming to movies, I have fan-dom for the film industries in each language.

            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allu_Arjun"> Allu Arjun</a> sir in Tollywood. I am not that attracted
          towards Sandalwood, but am really crazy for KGF Chapter-2. Die hard fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe">Marvel</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_(film_series)">Harry potter</a>
          Universe in Hollywood. Crazy fan

            Depp</a> sir.
          I was a very big fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sushant_Singh_Rajput"> Sushant Singh Rajput</a> sir in Bollywood, but after his unexpected demise Bollywood took an exit from my fan-dom list.
